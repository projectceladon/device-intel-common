# BKMs and good practices related to audio configuration files and Makefiles

Please follow the rules described in this readme as they will

1. ease your work;
2. avoid divergence across branches and products;
3. ensure readability and cohesion of configuration files and makefiles.

If these rules are too long for you to read, read at least the "Rules of thumb"
sections.

In general, there are 3 problems that can arise:

1. Duplication;
2. Divergence;
3. Noise (unwanted/irrelevant information).

Duplication and divergence are solved by factorization but factorization may
introduce noise because a configuration file covering all possible use-cases may
not be wanted in the context of a product with reduced capabilities (e.g. tablet
vs. phone).

## Parameter-framework configuration files

The overall parameter-framework configuration files structure is described
here:
<https://github.com/01org/parameter-framework/blob/master/Schemas/README.md>.

In the context of Android, there are additional details:

1.  In order to avoid duplication, the build system shall decide at build time
    whether tuning is allowed. To that end, the following rules shall be
    respected:
    
    * the top-level configuration file (e.g.
      `ParameterFrameworkConfiguration.xml`) shall have an additional `.in`
      extension (e.g. `ParameterFrameworkConfiguration.xml.in`);
    * it shall set the "TuningAllowed" property to `@TUNING_ALLOWED@`;
    * the makefile shall change this value at build time (see an example in
      `AndroidBoard.mk`), using the BUILD_REPLACE_PATTERNS_IN_FILE macro.
    
    That allows to maintain only one file per PFW instance instead of two.

2.  In the same way, when a Structure file is used in several products with
    only a change in a Subsystem-level mapping, the same mechanism as described
    above shall be used. For instance, the RouteSubsystem Structure file is
    often the same for all platforms and only the name of the soundcard on the
    platform changes (`Mapping="Card:foobar"` in the `<Subsystem>` tag). In
    this example, this can be achieved with `Mapping=Card:@SOUND_CARD_NAME@`.
    The macro BUILD_REPLACE_PATTERNS_IN_FILE can be used to replace this pattern
    by the right value at build time (see below an explanation about this macro).

3.  The `xi:include` mechanism in Structure files should be used wisely. Its
    purpose is to factorize parts of Structures that can be reused and allow to:
    
    * write concise Structure files;
    * differentiate Structure files while avoid divergence: a full-blown
      Structure file (e.g. phone) will include all ComponentLibraries whereas a
      minimal Structure file (e.g. tablet) will only include a subset of those.
    
    Avoid creating non-reusable ComponentLibraries (i.e. tied to a product) or
    causing the Structure to contain unused parameters on the target product:
    this will add noise and clients do not want it. Think of the difference
    between evaluation board, tablet, phone, dual-sim phone, etc.
    
    Conclusion: learn the difference between the two usages of ComponentTypes:
    
    * As reusable base types (e.g. the output devices defined by android);
    * As a convenience for instantiating the same list of components on
      different products (e.g. the list of platform routes).

4. In the same way, the Settings files shall be split in a way that prevents
   duplication, divergence and noise. It is a good idea to split the ".pfw"
   files according to the components they contain and split again according to
   the features they enable, when possible.

### Rules of thumb

* Do not duplicate a file if you can easily differentiate it at build time.
  Instead, write a template and specialize it at build time.
* Use `xi:include` and factorize base ComponentTypes whenever possible; put the
  factorized file at the lowest relevant level (lower: common, higher:
  product-specific). Keep in mind that it might evolve and have several
  versions, which is fine but might cause duplication to avoid version
  conflict.
* Learn to identify the difference between a) reusable building blocks
  and b) mere copy/paste avoidance (subject to divergence) - see item 3 above.
* Split ".pfw" files whenever relevant and "commonalize" when possible.

## Makefiles

There are 2 important kinds of makefiles:

1. AndroidBoard.mk;
2. device.mk (sometimes referred to as "product.mk" in mixins);

The boundary between them is a bit fuzzy but the way we use them for audio
packages and configuration files is:

* device.mk lists which meta-packages must be included in the image;
* AndroidBoard.mk defines these meta-packages.

The build system uses `device/intel/<board>/<product>/AndroidBoard.mk` (to
which we will refer to as *top-level AndroidBoard.mk*. For audio-specific
targets, we recommend 4 levels of AndroidBoard.mk:

1. the product-specific audio-AndroidBoard.mk, found at
   `device/intel/<board>/<product>/audio/AndroidBoard.mk`, defining the audio
   meta-package for the product;
2. the product-specific pfw-AndroidBoard.mk, found at
   `device/intel/<board>/<product>/audio/parameter-framework/AndroidBoard.mk`;
3. the platform-specific pfw-AndroidBoard.mk, found at
   `device/intel/<board>/audio/parameter-framework/AndroidBoard.mk`;
4. the common pfw-AndroidBoard.mk, found at
   `device/intel/common/audio/parameter-framework/AndroidBoard.mk`.

The top-level AndroidBoard.mk shall include number 1 in the list above which
will in turn include number 2 and so on for 3 and 4.

The directory structure will then look like this:

    device/intel/
    |-- common/audio/parameter-framework
    |   `-- AndroidBoard.mk (#4)
    `-- <platform>/
        |-- audio/
        |   `-- parameter-framework/
        |       `-- AndroidBoard.mk (#3, includes #4)
        `-- <board>/
            |-- device.mk
            |-- audio/
            |   |-- parameter-framework/
            |   |   `-- AndroidBoard.mk (#2, includes #3)
            |   `-- AndroidBoard.mk (#1, includes #2)
            `-- AndroidBoard.mk (top-level, includes #1)

### Rules of thumb:

* Keep the content of device.mk small: if possible, only one package in
  device.mk, which will then point to all needed packages.
* Put as many target definitions as possible in the common AndroidBoard.mk
* Use phony packages with meaningful names and "required modules" to represent
  a bundle of packages (e.g. `parameter-framework.audio.baytrail` as phony
  target depending on `parameter-framework.audio.common` and all
  baytrail-specific targets.)
* When creating a target for a Structure file, add its plugin library as
  required module (e.g. `LOCAL_REQUIRED_MODULE := libfs-subsystem`); do the same
  for each ComponentLibrary it uses.
* When available, use a convenience build rule (e.g. for generating the
  Settings files); they are documented in dedicated sections below.

## Parameter-framework XML generation build rule

We provide a build rule for generating parameter-framework XML Settings (aka
Domains) files using ".pfw" files and, optionaly, a pre-existing Settings file.
This is similar to the ones provided by the Android build system (through
instructions like `include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)`).

Here is a usage example followed by an explanation:

    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := AudioConfigurableDomains-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml
    LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional
    LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := ETC
LOCAL_PROPRIETARY_MODULE := true
    LOCAL_MODULE_RELATIVE_PATH := parameter-framework/Settings/Audio

    # Refresh tunning + routing domain file for rt5640-default
    LOCAL_ADDITIONAL_DEPENDENCIES := \
        parameter-framework.audio.common \
        parameter-framework.audio.baytrail \
        ParameterFrameworkConfiguration-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml \
        AudioClass-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml \
        CodecSubsystem-bytcr-rt564x-common.xml \
        CodecSubsystem-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml \
        SstSubsystem-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml \
        SstSubsystem-bytcr-rt56xx-common.xml \

    PFW_TOPLEVEL_FILE := $(TARGET_OUT_VENDOR_ETC)/parameter-framework/ParameterFrameworkConfiguration-bytcr-rt5640-default.xml
    PFW_CRITERIA_FILE := $(COMMON_PFW_CONFIG_PATH)/AudioCriteria.txt
    PFW_TUNING_FILE := $(LOCAL_PATH)/Settings/Audio/AudioConfigurableDomains-bytcr-rt5640-default.Tuning.xml
    PFW_EDD_FILES := \
        $(PLATFORM_PFW_CONFIG_PATH)/Settings/Audio/routing_scalpe_common.pfw \
        $(LOCAL_PATH)/Settings/Audio/bytcr-rt5640-default.pfw
    include $(BUILD_PFW_SETTINGS)

The important parts are the `PFW_`-prefixed variables:

* `PFW_TOPLEVEL_FILE`: the top-level configuration file for xml generation
* `PFW_CRITERIA_FILE`: the file containing the criteria, their types and their
    values
* `PFW_TUNING_FILE` (optional): an XML file containing existing settings to be
    augmented
* `PFW_EDD_FILES`: a list of files using the ".pfw" (aka Extended Domain
    Description) language

After using the `PFW_` variables, you must call `include $(BUILD_PFW_SETTINGS)`
to trigger XML generation.
This variable is defined by `AndroidBoard.mk`.

## Replace patterns in configuration files

We provide a build rule to replace patterns by their associated values in
configuration files.

Here is a usage example:

    include $(CLEAR_VARS)
    LOCAL_MODULE := ParameterFrameworkConfiguration.xml
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(LOCAL_MODULE).in
    LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional
    LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS := ETC
LOCAL_PROPRIETARY_MODULE := true
    LOCAL_MODULE_RELATIVE_PATH := parameter-framework
    LOCAL_REQUIRED_MODULES := \
        WM8281Subsystem.xml \
        IMCSubsystem.xml \
        SstSubsystem.xml
    REPLACE_PATTERNS := @SOUND_CARD_NAME@=floridaaudio \
                        @TUNING_ALLOWED@=true
    include $(BUILD_REPLACE_PATTERNS_IN_FILE)

Important variables are the following ones;
* `LOCAL_SRC_FILES`: the input file containing the patterns to be replaced
* `REPLACE_PATTERNS`: contains a list of space separated pairs, each describing
    a pattern and its value. A pattern is separated from its value by a '=' character.
* `PATTERN_SEPARATOR`: optional variable that can be used to specify a different
    separator for the patterns. By default its value is '='.

Here, we will replace @SOUND_CARD_NAME@ by 'floridaaudio' and @TUNING_ALLOWED@
by 'true' in the file '$(LOCAL_MODULE).in'.

The call to `include $(BUILD_REPLACE_PATTERNS_IN_FILE)` triggers the whole process.
