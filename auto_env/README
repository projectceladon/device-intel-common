This folder contains files for booting up Android in Qemu.

Hardware required
-----------------
Verified on NUC7i7BNH, you are welcome to try other x86 hardware which supports GVT-g (5th,
6th, 7th or 8th SoC Generation Intel Core Processor, E3_v4, E3_v5 or E3_v6 Xeon Processor ).

Software required
-----------------
Verified on ClearLinux OS 30870 and Ubuntu 18.04.2. Any later version should also work.
NOTE: Earlier Host OS version probably doesnâ€™t work with the helper scripts to setup
	the environment, you may need to follow the GVT-g wiki page to setup
	the KVM/QEMU environment. (https://github.com/intel/gvt-linux/wiki/GVTg_Setup_Guide)

How to start
------------
It will setup enviornment automatically on Ubuntu and clearlinux.

	$cp -r $pwd ~/aaas && cd ~/aaas && chmod +x *.sh
	$sudo ./setup.sh
	$reboot

The android image in USB could boot by:

	$cd ~/aaas
	$sudo ./start_android_usb.sh

Android will boot up to UI in a qemu window, and now you could enjoy it.
