Telemetry keys need to be installed on device. The zipped archive that
contains the keys can be found in vendor/intel/telemetry-client/keys. The
ideal way would be to install the keys from those archives directly.
Until the best way to do so (see IRDA-298) can be determined we extract
the keys into LOCAL_PATH/telemetry/keys and install them from here

We are not able to install keys directly from the telemetry-client repo
because of the checks done in build/core/tasks/vendor_module_check.mk.
For example:

build/core/tasks/vendor_module_check.mk:70: *** Error: vendor PRODUCT_COPY_FILES file
"vendor/intel/telemetry-client/keys/all/rsa.LSeo4ScbXV-aa.x509.pem:system/etc/tm/keys/all/rsa.LSeo4ScbXV-aa.x509.pem"
has unknown owner.  Stop.
