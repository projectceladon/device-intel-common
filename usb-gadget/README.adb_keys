Intel adb keys documentation
============================

If you want to connect to the device without manual secure adb authorization
please copy gmin_adb_key.priv to ${HOME}/.android/adbkey and the gmin@intel public key
from adb_keys to ${HOME}/.android/adbkey.pub.

The other keys from the adb_keys file are for the test slaves.
