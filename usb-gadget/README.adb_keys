Intel adb keys documentation
============================

- For security concerns, empty adb keys to avoid the risk of exposure.

- It's better to prepare adb keys locally if necessary.
If you want to connect to the device without manual secure adb authorization
please copy gmin_adb_key.priv to ${HOME}/.android/adbkey and the gmin@intel public key
from adb_keys to ${HOME}/.android/adbkey.pub.

The other keys from the adb_keys file are for the test slaves.
